26th of September: uploaded game in a version 1.0

27th of September: Version 1.1 was uploaded!
- Some minor changes you can see there, for example:
    - I changed apple's size so game looks more accurate and smooth
    - I have also optimized object rendering (snakes, apples, etc.) so you'll have a lot less screen freezes and things like a disappearing apple before you notice it's been eaten
    - Also, I tried to center some of the text to make it more pleasing to the eye.
